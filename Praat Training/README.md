# Introduction to Praat

##Basic Training

On the right, are some short Video Guides on the basic of using Praat.
They cover:

- Opening, viewing, and removing files.
- Creating and using TextGrids for annotation.
- Getting rid of the IPA chart in the Editor window.
-  Measuring duration.
- Measuring formants visually.
- Estimating fundamental frequency (f0).
- Segmenting an utterance.
- Saving your work!

##Test yourself

Once you are ready, you can download and test your new-found Praat skills using the files zipped below.

1. Open the wav and the TextGrid files.
2. View the sound and the TextGrid together and listen to the sound.
3. Remove the TextGrid from the Objects Window.
4. Create a new TextGrid for annotation of the sound object containing:
        a. an interval tier called "vowel"
        b. a point tier called "measurement"
3. Annotate the "vowel" tier in the TextGrid to show the /i/ vowel in see.
4. Annotate the "measurement" tier in the TextGrid to show the point where you are going to take your measurement.(Choose the centre of the /i/ vowel.)
t. Calculate the fundamental frequency at the measurement point using the three methods shown in video E:
        a. by identifying the fundamental oscillation in the waveform
        b. by analysing the harmonics in the narrowband spectrogram
        c. using Praat's built-in pitch estimation function
5. Measure F1, F2, and F3 visually.
7. Find out how to use Praat's formant estimation function.
8. Compare your formant peak measurements with the values you get from Praat's inbuilt feature.
9. Save the sound file and your textgrid as a Collection file.
6. Remove all from the Object Window without closing Praat.
