# Identifying and Transcribing Consonant Sounds

This folder contains two PowerPoint Presentations:

## 1. Identifying and Decribing Consonants

  There are two activities in this presentation.

  #### A. Describing consonants: introspective activity
  
  This uses a series of VCV words in from English. The aim to is practise saying each word, decide on voicing, place, and manner, and then to select the most appropriate symbol from the Pulmonic Consonants IPA chart. It includes the double-articulations \[w\] (and possibly \[ ç\] for some varieties of English) to raise awareness that the pulmonic chart does not contain all possible pulmonic consonant sounds. It also raises awareness of affricates. (Note that these are narrow phonetic transcriptions, so the retracted diacritic is used with the first element of each affricate.)

   #### B. Describing consonants:  ear training

   This involves listening to series of VCV utterances and selecting the most appropriate sound from the IPA Pulmonic Consonants chart. It includes a voiceless alveolar tap to raise awareness that not all potential pulmonic sounds are covered in the chart but that they can be represented using diacritics.
   
## 2. Multiple Articulations
   
   There are two activities in this presentation.
   
   #### A. Double Articulations
   
   The listener has to identify, describe, and choose the correct IPA symbol for three different double articulations.
   
   #### B. Secondary Articulations and Places of Articulation
   
   This task requires the listener to write phonetic transcripions short words in English which capture allophonic variatin, secondary articulation and variations in place of articulation for consonant sounds.
   
   The first four sets of words reflect variations across varieties of English while the last two represented variations in speech which may be associated with non-normative speech production.
